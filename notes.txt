I have two related programs:

Jison.js — an LALR(1) lookahead parser generator written in JavaScript.

sonar.coffee — an intended clone of Jison.js, rewritten in idiomatic CoffeeScript.

I need help with the following:

Understand Jison.js: Analyze the code to understand the full structure and flow of the parser generation algorithm, including:

The major functions and their roles

Key variables and data structures

How the LALR(1) algorithm is implemented step-by-step

Overall logic and purpose of each section

Compare with sonar.coffee: On a function-by-function (or logical unit) basis, verify that sonar.coffee faithfully implements the same algorithm and produces equivalent output.

The CoffeeScript version should use idiomatic constructs (e.g., comprehensions, implicit returns, chained calls) and not look like a line-by-line translation.

However, the logic, structure, and algorithmic behavior should remain consistent with the original.

The goal is to ensure that sonar.coffee is a clean, idiomatic, but algorithmically identical implementation of Jison.js. Please assist with both understanding and validating the equivalence.
